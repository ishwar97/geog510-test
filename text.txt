Buffering
Buffering creates a zone around a geographical feature. This operation is commonly used for proximity analysis, such as determining areas within a certain distance of a road or river.

Spatial Joins
Spatial joins combine attributes of two spatial datasets based on their spatial relationship. This can be useful for linking point data to the nearest polygon or aggregating values within a given region.

Intersection
The intersection operation identifies overlapping areas between two spatial datasets. It is commonly used in land-use planning and environmental analysis.

Union
A union operation merges multiple spatial datasets into a single dataset while preserving all features from the input datasets.

Clip
The clip operation extracts features from one dataset based on the boundaries of another dataset. This is useful for focusing analysis on a specific area of interest.

Dissolve
Dissolve aggregates features based on a common attribute, simplifying the dataset and reducing complexity.

Geocoding
Geocoding converts addresses into geographic coordinates, making it possible to map locations from textual data.

Reprojection
Reprojection changes the coordinate reference system (CRS) of spatial data, ensuring compatibility between datasets with different projections.

Raster Analysis
Raster analysis involves operations on grid-based data, such as elevation models or satellite imagery. Common tasks include calculating slope, aspect, and performing classifications.

Conclusion
These geospatial operations are fundamental in GIS workflows, enabling efficient spatial data analysis and decision-making.
